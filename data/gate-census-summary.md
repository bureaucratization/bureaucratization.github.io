## Top 5 longest-lived constraints
- merge-branch-main-agent: 2026-07-31 -> 2026-09-09 (2 commits, src)
- config:agency-auto-evaluation: 2026-08-08 -> 2026-09-13 (0 commits, config)
- provider-backoff-contract: 2026-08-16 -> 2026-09-09 (5 commits, docs)
- integrate-and-verify: 2026-03-11 -> 2026-03-27 (2 commits, unchecked)

## Top 5 most-hardened constraints (by commit count)
- audit-cycle-cleanup-round: 5 commits (2026-02-15 -> 2026-02-15, unchecked)
- merge-candidate-wgcid-blake3: 5 commits (2026-07-28 -> 2026-07-31, unchecked)
- provider-backoff-contract: 5 commits (2026-08-16 -> 2026-09-09, docs)
- make-verify-a: 3 commits (2026-03-04 -> 2026-03-04, unchecked)
- push-and-verify-ci: 3 commits (2026-03-13 -> 2026-03-13, unchecked)

## Notable removal events
- **2026-09-13 configuration disable**: `.wg/config.toml.bak-2026-09-13T02-32-08Z` vs live config — `auto_evaluate` true->false; `verify_autospawn_enabled = false` (verify gates no longer spawn agents autonomously); [agency] block retuned. Gates were not deleted; they were switched from autonomous to manual — consistent with the paper's 'subtraction at the configuration layer' (draft §3.5), refined: **the recovery disabled gate *enforcement autonomy*, not gate existence.**
- Removal-verb governance commits cluster in June (autopoietic-loop recovery) and September.

## Confidence caveats
- Suffix-based clustering (topic in parens) is high confidence; key-phrase clustering merges/splits imperfectly — treat medium-confidence rows as indicative.
- Commit-subject vocabulary is a proxy; silent constraint changes inside src/ without governance vocabulary are invisible to this census (motivates §6 'gate ledger' feature).
- Config snapshots exist only for Aug 8 and Sep 13; earlier config-layer ratcheting is unrecorded.

## The singleton finding (added 2026-09-16, post-analysis)

- **290 of 311 constraint topics (93%) have exactly one commit** — born once, never revisited, never retired. Only 21 topics were ever hardened (2+ commits), and only 14 removal-verb governance commits exist in the entire history.
- Interpretation: the ratchet is not a story of constraints being *maintained* — it is a story of constraints being **emitted**. Governance in this system behaved like an append-only log written by each incident's responding agent. Fire-and-forget rule-making at machine speed, with retirement ~40x rarer than birth (14 removal commits + 1 config event vs ~344 additions).
- This sharpens the paper's §4.1: the missing mechanism is not gate review (nothing was reviewed) but **gate amortization of any kind** — there was no path by which a constraint could naturally die.
